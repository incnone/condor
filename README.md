This is a small change to a file in Remi Coulom's Bayesian Elo estimator (http://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/) that allows printing of the covariance matrix (the command printcovariance in the elo calculator). Was using this to get more accurate predictions of 3-game match outcomes (which may tend more toward even outcomes when Elos are positively correlated).
